               updates to update the soft ware in the embedded electronic
               control units. The update process can affect the safety of the
               involved users, thus requires a comprehensive and elaborate
               security architecture ensuring the confidentiality and the
               integrity of the exchanged data, as well as protecting the
               privacy of the involved users. In this paper, we propose an
               automotive security architecture employing Blockchain to tackle
               the implicated security and privacy challenges. We describe our
               proof-of-concept implementation of a Blockchain-based software
               update system, use it to show the applicability of our
               architecture for automotive systems, and evaluate different
               aspects of our architecture.",

    abstract =  {The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks. The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation. CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments.},
